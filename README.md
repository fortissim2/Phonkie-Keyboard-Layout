I have no clue how to use GitHub sooooooooooo enjoy my layout :)

Goals I was aiming for:
- Rolls
- Okay Sfb%
- Easy NL, SC alts for Monkeytype vocab (top 200)
- No RL / LR bigram for top 200 (specifically "early" and "world")
- Decent punctuation at decent spots

Stats from https://bit.ly/keyboard-layouts-doc:
```Rolls: 46.15%
Alternates: 39.97%
Onehands: 1.90%
Redirects: 5.81%
Sfb: 1.058% | 0.823%
Dsfb: 6.026%
Lsb: 1.63%
In-roll ratio: 1.54```

I also uploaded the layout here because my friend told me to **(warning furry content)**
