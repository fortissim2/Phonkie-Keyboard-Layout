# Phonkie Keyboard Layout

## Layout

```
I have no clue how to use GitHub sooooooooooo enjoy my layout :)

## Design
**Goals I was aiming for:**
- Rolls
- Okay Sfb%
- Easy `NL` and `SC` alts for Monkeytype vocab (top 200)
- No `RL` bigram for top 200 (specifically "early" and "world")
- Decent punctuation at decent spots

Huge thanks to my friend **ec0vid** for providing these stats for me! :)

## History
Here's the first iteration of the Phonkie layout (originally named "phonky"):
```
z m l w f  k b u o y
r h n s g  p t e a i ;
j , q c x  v d ' . /
```
The `NL` bigram could easily be alted (same as `DE` on QWERTY, N with left index and L with left middle), as well as SC (S with left middle and C with left index). However, I quickly found out that there weren't a lot of left-hand inward rolls, so I decided to alter the home row a little bit to put S with the vowels.
Soon after, I created this:
```
/ l m d b  x f u o y
r n t h p  g s e a i ;
j q v k z  c w ' . ,
```
I thought this was a big improvement from last time, the left hand looked extremely promising (`TH`, `NT`, `RN` inward rolls) and `NL` was still altable (N with left middle). I also did a cycle between the `/`, `z` and `;` keys, although that didn't do much to improve the stats.
I didn't notice the `XC` bigram for words like "except", "excitement", etc. so I did some more minor swaps to get the final result:
```
q l m p b  z f u o y
r n t h d  c s e a i /
j x v k ;  w g ' . ,
```
